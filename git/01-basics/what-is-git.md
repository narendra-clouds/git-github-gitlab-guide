# What is Git?

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) used to track changes in source code during software development.

It helps developers:
- Track file changes
- Work in teams
- Maintain project history
- Restore previous versions

## What is Version Control?

Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time so you can recall specific versions later.

Example:
If you make a mistake in your code today, Git allows you to go back to yesterday’s version.

## Why Git is Important

- Prevents code loss
- Enables collaboration
- Supports branching and merging
- Fast and lightweight
- Works offline

---

## Centralized vs Distributed Version Control

Centralized (e.g., SVN):
- Single central server
- Requires internet access

Distributed (Git):
- Every developer has a full copy
- Works offline
- Faster operations
